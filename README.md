# rps_game


This is the second attempt for a Javascript "Rock Paper Scissors" game. Refer to "Reflections" for a summary of the first attempt.

The second attempt at the console.log version of the game went smoother and took much less time. I experiemented with case switches for the "Player" and "Computer" choices and was able to create a round played with it using string concatenations. I like the set up but unfortunately could not get it to work in a loop. I swapped to a modified version of my original function using "if/else if/else" with "&&" and "||" while practicing arrow functions instead. I like how this turned out. It's tighter and I have a firmer grasp of thse concepts.

After setting up the GUI, I ran into a few problems I wasn't able to figure out. I had wanted to create a modal pop up with buttons that triggered once a game was over. Unfortunately, I had issues figuring out what route to take with it. I had wanted to use actual images as the buttons and WAS able to make that work. I could not get the button selections to mirror the images. I opted to use unicode characters for the icons instead. I was able to add back in switches with my event listeners which was nice for extra practice. Ultimately, the initial exposure and follow up review helped a lot. I was able to go into this attempt with more intent. Before my next project, I plan on taking a few days to review more and maybe tweak this before I continue on.





Reflections on first attempt:

I come from a humanities background academically and a sales background professionally. Math and logic have not been my traditional strengths. I'm enrolled in a first semester Programming degree currently, mainly supplementing the curriculum with The Odin Project. HTML and CSS were pretty straight forward to me but Javascript has presented issues. It's outside my comfort zone and my first real road block. 

The first attempt was clunky, bloated, and difficult to read. I didn't understand the fundementals wholly so allowed myself to experiment. That caused the first attempt to spiral uncontrollably. I would try out code I saw on stack overflow or other repositories to supplement learning. When starting the GUI portion, I realized how much I didn't understand and started to fumble my way through. After spending far too many hours trying to steamroll my way through, I gave up and decided to go through the fundementals again on The Odin Project, MDN Web Docs, and Javascript.info to practice until I had a better grasp. The prior exposure did help solidify my understanding.
