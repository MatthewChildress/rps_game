# rps_game


This is the second attempt for a Javascript "Rock Paper Scissors" game. 







Reflections on first attempt:
The first attempt was clunky, bloated, and difficult to read. I didn't understand the fundementals wholly so allowed myself to experiment. I would try out code I saw on stack overflow or other repositories to supplement learning. After starting the GUI portion, I realized how much I didn't understand and started to fumble my way through.
